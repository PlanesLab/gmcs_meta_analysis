# *Review and meta-analysis of the gMCS approach for gene essentiality prediction in cancer metabolism*:
**PlanesLab** has developed the *genetic Minimal Cut Set (gMCS)* algorithm, an uncontextualized approach that exploits the concepts of synthetic lethality based on Constraint Based Modelling. These gMCSs define a set of genes whose knockout would render the cell unviable by disrupting a given metabolic pathway, thus, making impossible for the cell to proliferate. 

This repository holds the necessary code and data to perform a review on the current state of the methodology by performing a meta-analysis on many challenges of the gMCSs, such as the length importance, distinct thresholding techniques, and so on.

Thanks for reading!
